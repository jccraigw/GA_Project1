## What Is Unfinised?
1. Start button to begin game --- currently begins immediately after refresh
2. Animation for character and shark --- had trouble getting smaller sprite sheets to animate correctly
3. More level variation - want to incorporate more level and randomness to the barriers
4. Additional items to improve game play.
	


## Whats Next?
1. Mobile version - I am done with the desktop version. I have begun transfering this version to mobile. Mobile aready incorporates some of the unfinised features that the desktop has.
